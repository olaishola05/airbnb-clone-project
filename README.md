# airbnb-clone-project

## Brief Overview

The Airbnb Clone Project is a comprehensive, real-world application designed to simulate the development of a robust booking platform like Airbnb. It involves a deep dive into full-stack development, focusing on backend systems, database design, API development, and application security. This project enables learners to understand complex architectures, workflows, and collaborative team dynamics while building a scalable web application. To develop an understanding of integrating technologies like Django, MySQL, and GraphQL in a unified ecosystem.

## Team Roles

### Backend Developer

Responsible for implementing API endpoints, database schemas, and business logic.

### Database Administrator

Manages database design, indexing, and optimizations.

### DevOps Engineer

Handles deployment, monitoring, and scaling of the backend services.

### QA Engineer

Ensures the backend functionalities are thoroughly tested and meet quality standards.

## Technology Stack

- **Python**: The primary programming language used for backend development.
- **Django**: A high-level Python web framework used for building the RESTful API.
- **Django REST Framework**: Provides tools for creating and managing RESTful APIs.
- **PostgreSQL**: A powerful relational database used for data storage.
- **GraphQL**: Allows for flexible and efficient querying of data.
- **Celery**: For handling asynchronous tasks such as sending notifications or processing payments.
- **Redis**: Used for caching and session management.
- **Docker**: Containerization tool for consistent development and deployment environments.
- **CI/CD Pipelines**: Automated pipelines for testing and deploying code changes.

## Database Design

The database design for the Airbnb Clone Project is crucial for ensuring data integrity, scalability, and performance. The following key entities and their relationships are defined:

1. **User**: Represents the users of the platform, including hosts and guests.
   - Attributes: user_id, email, password, name, role (host/guest), etc.

2. **Property**: Represents the listings available for booking.
   - Attributes: property_id, host_id (FK), title, description, location, price, etc.
   - Relationships: Belongs to a User (host).

3. **Booking**: Represents a booking made by a guest for a specific property.
   - Attributes: booking_id, property_id (FK), guest_id (FK), start_date, end_date, status, etc.
   - Relationships: Belongs to a Property and a User (guest).

4. **Review**: Represents reviews left by guests for properties.
   - Attributes: review_id, property_id (FK), guest_id (FK), rating, comment, etc.
   - Relationships: Belongs to a Property and a User (guest).

5. **Payment**: Represents payment transactions for bookings.
   - Attributes: payment_id, booking_id (FK), amount, payment_method, status, etc.
   - Relationships: Belongs to a Booking.

## Feature Breakdown

### User Authentication and Authorization

- Implement user registration, login, and profile management.
- Use JWT for secure authentication.

### Property Management

- Implement CRUD operations for property listings.
- Allow users to upload images and set availability.

### Booking System

- Implement booking creation, cancellation, and history.
- Send email notifications for booking confirmations.

### Review System

- Allow guests to leave reviews and ratings for properties.
- Implement review moderation and reporting.

### Payment Integration

- Integrate with a payment gateway for processing transactions.
- Implement payment confirmation and receipt generation.

### Search and Filter

- Implement search functionality for properties based on location, price, and availability.
- Allow users to filter properties by amenities, ratings, and other criteria.

## API Security

- **Authentication**: Use JWT tokens for secure user authentication.
- **Authorization**: Implement role-based access control (RBAC) to restrict access to sensitive endpoints.
- **Rate Limiting**: Apply rate limiting to prevent abuse of the API and protect against DDoS attacks.
- **Data Validation**: Ensure all input data is validated to prevent SQL injection and other attacks.
- **HTTPS**: Enforce HTTPS to secure data in transit.
- **CORS**: Configure Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) to control which domains can access the API.
- **Logging and Monitoring**: Implement logging for API requests and errors, and set up monitoring to detect anomalies.

## CI/CD Pipeline

CI/CD (Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment) pipelines are essential for automating the process of integrating code changes, running tests, and deploying applications. They ensure that code is always in a deployable state, reduce manual errors, and speed up the development cycle.

For this project, we can use tools like GitHub Actions for automating the CI/CD process, Docker for containerization, and possibly a cloud provider like AWS or Heroku for deployment. The pipeline will include stages for building the application, running tests, and deploying to production.
